<abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr> was created by <strong><mark color="grey">Sir Tim Berners-Lee</mark></strong> in late <em>1991</em> but was not released officially, which was published in <em>1995</em> as <acronym>HTML 2.0. HTML 4.01</acronym> was published in late <em>1999</em> and was a major version of <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML
</abbr>.</address> 
</p>

<p>
      <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr> is a very evolving markup language and has evolved with various versions updating. Long
      before its revised standards and specifications are carried in, each version has allowed its user to create web pages in the much easier and
      prettier way and make sites very efficient.

<blockquote>
     <dfn><kbd>HTML 1.0</kbd> was released in <em>1993</em> with the intention of sharing information which can be readable and accessible via web 
     browsers. But not much of the developers were involved in creating websites. So the language was also not growing.
      </dfn>
</blockquote>
</p>

<p><blockquote>Then comes the <kbd>HTML 2.0</kbd>, published in <em>1995</em>; which contains all the features of <kbd>HTML 1.0</kbd> along with that 
     few additional features; which remained as the standard markup language for designing and creating websites until January <em>1997</em> and 
     refined various core features of <strong>HTML</strong>.
</blockquote></p>

<p><blockquote>
    Then comes the <kbd>HTML 3.0</kbd>, where Dave Raggett who introduced a fresh paper or draft on <strong>HTML</strong>. It included improved new   
    features of <strong>HTML</strong>, giving more powerful characteristics for webmasters in designing web pages. But these powerful features of new  
    <strong>HTML</strong> slowed down the browser in applying further improvements.
</blockquote></p>

<p><blockquote>
    Then comes the <kbd>HTML 4.01</kbd> which is widely used and was a successful version of <strong>HTML</strong> before <kbd>HTML 5.0</kbd>, which 
    is currently released and used worldwide. <q>HTML 5 can be said for as an extended version of HTML 4.01 which was published in the year 
    <em>2012</em>.</q>
